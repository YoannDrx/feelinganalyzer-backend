Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.

Have fun coding!

## Description 

The objective of this challenge is to build an application able to analyze a sentence typed by a user (in English only) and to determine its sentiment

(happy, angry or neutral) thanks to a third-party service: the NodeJS sentiment module.

According to the determined sentiment, your application will have to look like one of these three models (in order: happy, angry, neutral).
